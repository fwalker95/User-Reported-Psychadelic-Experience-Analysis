# User Reported Psychadelic Experience Analysis


Project WIP goes in here

Overview:

ETL (extract, transform, loaf) end-to-end data project 

Considerations:

NoSQL vs RDBMS.
I have structured and unstructured data to store. Which database is better for this?

Part 1. Getting the Data.

Web scraping erowid.com using BeautifulSoup

I tripped the units off of the measurements but soon realizes reports use different unit standards. So I unmade my decision and decided to keep units in the databse for now to be covnerted for later. 


Part 2. Storing the Data

Convert to CSV -> into Google Sheets
